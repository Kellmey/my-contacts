How to use this application

This application was created to store my contact information. When entering the contact information it is stored as a "contact card", for future reference. The "contact card" can also be deleted by clicking on the red icon on the far right of the "contact card". Field validation has been made use of to ensure that all fields should be populated before information can be stored. After all the fields are populated the "Add Contact" button should be clicked in order to store the information in the local storage.

I made use of the CRUD system to "Create", "Read", "Update" and "Delete" information.

Please install uuid version 4 and react router dom before attempting to run this application.
